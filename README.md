Here we provide all the data and the code to replicate all empirical exercises in the abovementioned paper.
You can access a freely available working paper version of the paper [here](https://www.jku.at/fileadmin/gruppen/108/ICAE_Working_Papers/wp76.pdf).

The repository contains all code and data to replicate all figures and tables in the paper. 
If you just want to replicate all figures and tables simply run `src/0_complete-replication.R`, but make sure that your working directory is set to the root of the repository and that all output folders exist.

If you want to experiment with the code or make robustness checks on your own, you can use all R files on their own, but make sure to install and attach all packages as in `src/0_complete-replication.R`.

For more information about the data and data sources see `data/meta_data.xlsx`.

The file `output/session_info.txt` contains information about the hardware as well as the packages used when the output for the original paper was produced.
